## 1. What is technical debt
### *Answer*

> Technical debt refers to the cost of maintaining and enhancing software over time. It is a metaphor used to describe the trade-off between investing in short-term workarounds, quick-fixes, and other shortcuts to meet immediate needs, and investing in more robust, long-term solutions that may require more time and resources up front.
The idea is that, just as financial debt incurs interest, technical debt incurs "interest" in the form of extra effort that must be expended in the future to maintain or enhance the software. This extra effort can come in the form of additional development work, increased testing, or higher maintenance costs.
The goal is to minimize technical debt by designing and building software in a maintainable and scalable way, so that it can be easily updated and extended as business needs change. This is important because as the technical debt increases, it can become harder and more expensive to make changes to the software, which can slow down development and impact the business.

## 2. What is .net assembly and what are the main components of assembly And what are the types of assembly
### *Answer*

>.NET assembly is a fundamental unit of deployment, versioning, and security in the .NET framework. It is a collection of one or more files that are used to build and run applications and libraries in the .NET environment.

>The main components of an assembly are:

* Metadata: This contains information about the assembly, such as the types, methods, and fields defined in the assembly, as well as information about the assembly's dependencies.

* MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language): This is the machine-independent code that is generated by the compiler. This code is then Just-In-Time (JIT) compiled to machine code when the assembly is loaded and executed.

* Resources: These can include files such as images, audio files, or localized strings that are included with the assembly.

* Assembly manifest: This contains information about the assembly, including its version number, culture, and strong name. It also describes the assembly's dependencies on other assemblies and the permissions required to run the assembly.

> Assemblies can be either a single file or a multi-file assembly, which contains more than one file. A single file assembly contains both the assembly manifest and the MSIL code in a single file with the extension .dll or .exe. A multi-file assembly contains the assembly manifest in a separate file with the extension .manifest, and the MSIL code in one or more files with the extension .dll or .exe.

> In the .NET framework, there are two types of assemblies: private assemblies and shared assemblies.

* Private assemblies: These are assemblies that are intended to be used by a single application, and they are typically located in the application's local folder. They are not intended to be shared by multiple applications.

* Shared assemblies: These are assemblies that are intended to be used by multiple applications. They are typically installed in the global assembly cache (GAC), which is a special folder where shared assemblies are stored. They are also typically given a strong name, which is a unique name that includes a public key and a digital signature. This allows for versioning and ensures that different versions of the same assembly can coexist on the same system.

> Additionally, there are also satellite assemblies, which are assemblies that contain resources for a specific language or culture. They are used to provide localized resources for an application, such as translated strings or images. Satellite assemblies are typically deployed in the same directory as the main assembly, and they have a specific naming convention, such as "MyAssembly.resources.dll"

# 3. Can you explain the difference between the managed and unmanaged code in the .NET framework?
## Answer
> Managed code is code that runs within the CLR and is managed by the CLR's memory manager, while unmanaged code is code that runs outside of the CLR and is not managed by the CLR's memory manager. Examples of unmanaged code in the .NET framework include C/C++ code that is called via P/Invoke.

The CLR is the runtime environment of the .NET framework and is responsible for executing code, managing memory, handling exceptions, and providing security.

In C#, exceptions are handled using try-catch blocks. A try-catch block is used to handle exceptions that may be thrown within the try block, while a try-finally block is used to execute code regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not.

Value types are data types that hold a specific value, such as an integer or a float, while reference types are data types that hold a reference to an object in memory. Examples of value types in C# include int and float, while examples of reference types include classes and strings.

A class is a blueprint for an object, while an interface defines a contract for a class to implement. Classes can have fields, properties, methods, and events, while interfaces can only have method signatures.

The "using" statement is used to ensure that an object is disposed of after it is no longer needed. It is typically used with objects that implement the IDisposable interface, such as the SqlConnection class.

An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is typically used as a base class for other classes, while a sealed class is a class that cannot be inherited.

A delegate is a type that can hold a reference to a method, while an event is a mechanism for a class to notify other classes of an occurrence. A delegate is used to define the signature of the event-handling method, while an event is used to raise and handle the event.

Threading in C# can be implemented using the Thread class or the Task class. The Thread class is the low-level threading API, while the Task class is a higher-level threading API that is built on top of the Thread class and is part of the Task Parallel Library (TPL).

A WebForm application is a web application that uses the WebForms technology, while an MVC (Model-View-Controller) application is a web application that follows the MVC design pattern. WebForms uses a page-based event model where the page handles events, while MVC uses a more traditional event model where the controller handles events.

A static class is a class that cannot be instantiated and contains only static members, while a singleton class is a class that can only be instantiated once, and it provides a global point of access to its members.
Dependency injection is a way of injecting dependencies into an object, rather than hard-coding them. In C#, it can be implemented using a DI container, such as Autofac or Ninject. The benefits of using dependency injection include improved testability, flexibility, and maintainability.
The String class is an immutable class, which means that once a string is created, its value cannot be changed. The StringBuilder class, on the other hand, is a mutable class that allows for



question
what is difference between iqueryable and ienumerable
IQueryable and IEnumerable are both interfaces in C# that define methods for working with collections of data. The main difference between the two is that IQueryable allows for the creation of LINQ queries that can be executed against a database, while IEnumerable is used for in-memory collections and the queries are executed locally.

IEnumerable is best used when working with small amounts of data that can be easily loaded into memory. It's useful for simple queries and operations that can be performed in a single pass.

IQueryable, on the other hand, is more powerful and is best used when working with large amounts of data that can't be loaded into memory all at once. It allows for the creation of complex, multi-step queries that are executed in a more efficient manner.

In short, IEnumerable is for in-memory collection and IQueryable is for database querying.



Question
what is caching
Caching is a technique used to temporarily store frequently accessed data in a more easily and quickly accessible location, such as memory or a dedicated cache server. The goal of caching is to improve the performance and scalability of a system by reducing the number of times that data needs to be retrieved from a slower or more resource-intensive location, such as a database or a remote web service.

There are different types of caching:

In-memory caching: The most common form of caching, which stores data in the memory of the server or application.
Disk caching: Storing data on disk, which is slower than in-memory caching but can be used for larger amounts of data.
Distributed caching: Storing data across multiple servers in a network, which allows for greater scalability and availability.
Caching can be implemented at different levels of an application stack, depending on the requirements:

Client-side caching: Caching data on the client-side, such as in a web browser's cache.
Server-side caching: Caching data on the server-side, such as in-memory caching or disk caching.
Reverse proxy caching: Caching data at the reverse proxy level, which is a server that sits in front of one or more web servers and handles requests on behalf of the web servers.
Caching can be used to improve the performance of a wide range of applications, such as web applications, mobile apps, and microservices.

It is important to note that caching has a time-to-live (TTL) parameter which is the time that the data is valid and stored in the cache. Once the data expires, it will be removed from the cache and will have to be retrieved again.


question
what is the difference between nunit and xunit
NUnit and xUnit are both unit testing frameworks for .NET. They are both open-source and actively maintained, and provide similar functionality for creating and running unit tests. However, there are some key differences between the two.

One of the main differences is the syntax for writing tests. NUnit uses a more traditional, attribute-based syntax for marking test methods, while xUnit uses a more fluent, method-based syntax. For example, in NUnit, a test method is marked with the [Test] attribute, while in xUnit, it is marked with the [Fact] attribute.

Another difference is that xUnit is designed to be more extensible and modular than NUnit. xUnit uses a more composable architecture, which allows developers to create their own custom test runners, test discoverers, and other components.

Another difference is the way how they handle test discovery and execution. NUnit loads all the tests in an assembly at once and then runs them, xUnit uses a more dynamic approach, it only loads the tests that are going to be executed, this could be an advantage when dealing with large test suites.

Additionally, xUnit has some features that are not present in NUnit. For example, xUnit has built-in support for test theories (tests that are parameterized with multiple sets of data) and collection fixtures (shared context for tests in a test collection).

Ultimately, the choice between NUnit and xUnit often comes down to personal preference, and both frameworks are good choices for unit testing in .NET. Both frameworks are widely used and have a large community of developers contributing to their development.


Questin
What is OOP

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of "objects", which are instances of classes that contain both data and behavior. OOP is a way of organizing and structuring code that is designed to make it more reusable, modular, and maintainable.

Some of the key concepts in OOP include:

Classes: These are templates or blueprints for creating objects. A class defines the properties (data) and methods (behavior) of an object.

Objects: These are instances of classes that contain both data and behavior. An object is an individual instance of a class and it has its own set of properties and methods.

Inheritance: This is a mechanism that allows one class to inherit the properties and methods of another class, allowing for code reuse and a more hierarchical organization of code.

Polymorphism: This is the ability for objects of different classes to be used interchangeably, as long as they implement a common interface.

Encapsulation: This is the practice of keeping the internal state and behavior of an object hidden from the outside world, and only exposing a public interface that can be used to interact with the object.

OOP is widely used in modern programming languages like Java, C#, Python, and many more. It's important to note that OOP is just one of the many programming paradigms and it's not the only way to solve a problem, other paradigms like functional programming and procedural programming also can be used to solve problems.



Question
What is polymorphism
Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that refers to the ability of objects of different classes to be used interchangeably, as long as they implement a common interface. Polymorphism allows you to write code that can work with multiple types of objects in a consistent and predictable way, without having to know or care about the specific type of the object at runtime.

There are two main types of polymorphism:

Compile-time polymorphism (also known as static polymorphism or overloading): This is achieved through method overloading, where multiple methods with the same name but different signatures can be defined in the same class or derived classes.

Run-time polymorphism (also known as dynamic polymorphism or overriding): This is achieved through method overriding, where a method in a derived class has the same name and signature as a method in the base class, and can be used to override the behavior of the base class method.

An example of polymorphism is a shape class hierarchy where a Shape class has a Draw() method, and derived classes like Circle, Square, and Triangle have their own implementation of the Draw() method, and using polymorphism, you can call the draw method on a Shape reference that could be a Circle, Square or Triangle without knowing the specific type of the object at runtime.



Quesiton
What is encapsulaltion
Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that refers to the practice of keeping the internal state and behavior of an object hidden from the outside world, and only exposing a public interface that can be used to interact with the object. The main goal of encapsulation is to protect the integrity of the object's internal state and to hide the implementation details of the object from the outside world.

Encapsulation is typically achieved through the use of access modifiers (such as public, private, protected, etc.) that control the visibility of the object's properties and methods. For example, a class can have a private field that represents the internal state of the object, and a public method that allows other objects to access or modify the internal state of the object in a controlled and predictable way.

Encapsulation provides several benefits such as:

It allows the developer to change the implementation of an object without affecting the code that uses the object.
It helps to isolate the effects of changes, making the system more robust and less prone to errors.
It promotes the use of a clear and consistent interface for interacting with the object, making the code more readable and maintainable.
It allows the developer to implement security mechanisms, such as access control, to prevent unauthorized access to the object's internal state and behavior.
It is important to note that encapsulation is not about hiding information, it is about controlling the access to the information and keeping the object's internal state and behavior consistent and predictable.




Quesiton
What is ingeritance
Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows one class to inherit the properties and methods of another class, allowing for code reuse and a more hierarchical organization of code. The class that inherits from another class is called a derived class, and the class from which it inherits is called a base class.

The main advantage of inheritance is that it allows a developer to create new classes that are based on existing classes, without having to rewrite the same code. The derived class inherits all of the properties and methods of the base class, and can also add new properties and methods or override existing ones.

For example, let's consider that you have a Vehicle class that has properties such as Make, Model, Year and methods such as Start(), Stop(), Accelerate() and you want to create a Car class that inherits from the Vehicle class, the Car class will have all properties and methods of the Vehicle class plus the additional properties and methods that are specific to cars such as NumberOfDoors, NumberOfSeats, etc.

Inheritance also allows for a more hierarchical organization of code, where a base class represents a general concept and derived classes represent more specific concepts. This makes it easier to understand and maintain the code, as the developer can easily see the relationship between classes and understand how the code is organized.

Inheritance is one of the fundamental concepts of OOP, and it is supported by most modern programming languages, including Java, C#, Python, and many more. It's important to note that Inheritance is just one way of achieving code reuse, other ways of code reuse are composition and interfaces.



Question
Liskov
The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is a principle in object-oriented programming that states that objects of a superclass should be able to be replaced with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. In simpler terms, it means that if a program is written to work with a certain type of object, it should be able to work with any subtype of that object without any modification.

For example, if you have a Vehicle class, and you create a Car class that inherits from the Vehicle class, the Liskov Substitution Principle states that any code that is written to work with a Vehicle object should be able to work with a Car object without any modification, because a Car is a type of Vehicle.

The Liskov Substitution Principle is related to the concept of polymorphism, which allows objects of different classes to be used interchangeably, as long as they implement a common interface. To follow the LSP, the derived classes should be substitutable for their base classes, and it should be able to use any derived class in place of its base class without altering the desirable properties of the program.

The LSP is important to make sure that the code is easy to understand, maintain, and extend. It helps to reduce the number of dependencies between different parts of the code, making the code more robust and less prone to errors.

It's important to note that the LSP is not a hard rule and it's not always easy or practical to follow it strictly. Sometimes, it's necessary to break the LSP in order to achieve other goals, such as performance or security. But it should be done with care, and always in a way that's easy to understand, maintain, and extend.
