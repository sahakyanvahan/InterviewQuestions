## 1. What is binding in WPF? What is the purpose of it?
### Answer
>In WPF, binding is a way to connect the data in your application's model (such as a view model) with the user interface controls that display that data. With binding, you can establish a relationship between a property of a UI control (such as the Text property of a TextBox) and a property of a data object, such as a property on your view model.

>The purpose of binding is to create a separation of concerns between the presentation layer and the application logic. By using data binding, you can keep your UI code focused on the display and behavior of the controls, while moving the logic for data access and manipulation to a separate layer.

>Binding in WPF works by defining a source and a target for the data. The source is typically a property on a view model or other data object, while the target is a property of a UI control. You can specify the binding relationship between the two by using a binding expression, which is a string that specifies the path to the source property.

>For example, here's how you might use binding to connect a TextBox control to a property on a view model:

```XML
<TextBox Text="{Binding MyProperty}" />
```

>In this example, we've set the Text property of the TextBox to a binding expression that references the MyProperty property on the view model. When the view is loaded, the binding engine will establish a connection between the Text property of the TextBox and the MyProperty property on the view model. Any changes to the MyProperty property will automatically update the Text displayed in the TextBox, and any changes made by the user in the TextBox will be reflected in the MyProperty property.

Overall, binding in WPF provides a powerful mechanism for creating dynamic, data-driven user interfaces that are easy to maintain and extend.

## 2. What is the types of binding in WPF?
### Answer
>In WPF, there are several types of bindings you can use to connect data from your application's model to the user interface controls that display that data. Here are some of the most common types:

> * **OneWay binding:** This type of binding updates the target property (the UI control) whenever the source property (the data object) changes. However, changes made to the target property by the user are not propagated back to the source property.

> * **TwoWay binding:** This type of binding updates both the source and target properties whenever either property changes. This allows changes made by the user in the UI to be propagated back to the data object, and vice versa.

> * **OneTime binding:** This type of binding updates the target property once when the binding is created, and then does not update it again. This is useful when you only need to display data once and do not need to keep it synchronized with the data object.

> * **OneWayToSource binding:** This type of binding updates the source property whenever the target property changes. This is useful when you need to capture user input and update the data object, but do not need to display the data in the UI.

> * **MultiBinding:** This type of binding allows you to combine multiple source properties into a single target property, using a converter to perform the necessary transformations. This is useful when you need to display complex data that requires multiple sources, such as a chart or graph.

> * **Priority binding:** This type of binding allows you to specify multiple bindings for a single target property, and specify the order in which they should be evaluated. This is useful when you have multiple sources of data that need to be combined in a specific order or with specific rules.

>Overall, the choice of binding type depends on the requirements of your application and the nature of the data you need to display and manipulate in the UI.

## 3. Is binding type different concept then binding modes?
### Answer
>Yes, binding types and binding modes are different concepts in WPF.

>Binding types refer to the way that data is bound to a UI control. The binding type determines whether data flows one way, two ways, or in a custom direction between the data source and the UI control.

>Binding modes, on the other hand, determine when data is updated between the data source and the UI control. The binding mode determines whether data is updated immediately when the user changes it in the UI control, or whether updates are deferred until a certain event or condition is met.

>Some common binding modes in WPF include:

> * **OneTime:** Data is only updated once when the binding is first created.

> * **OneWay:** Data is updated from the source to the target control, but not vice versa.

> * **TwoWay:** Data is updated in both directions between the source and target control.

> * **OneWayToSource:** Data is updated from the target control to the source, but not vice versa.

> * **Default:** The binding mode is determined by the type of control and property being bound.

>The choice of binding mode depends on the requirements of your application and the nature of the data being displayed and manipulated in the UI.

## 3. How do you handle user input validation in WPF?
### Answer
>In WPF, you can handle user input validation using a combination of data validation rules, validation error templates, and error feedback mechanisms. Here is an example of how to handle user input validation in WPF:

> 1. Define a data validation rule for your input field. For example, you can define a rule that checks whether the input is a valid email address.

```C#
public class EmailValidationRule : ValidationRule
{
    public override ValidationResult Validate(object value, CultureInfo cultureInfo)
    {
        try
        {
            var address = new MailAddress((string)value);
            return ValidationResult.ValidResult;
        }
        catch (FormatException)
        {
            return new ValidationResult(false, "Please enter a valid email address.");
        }
    }
}
```
> 2. Associate the validation rule with your input field using a Binding object. For example, you can bind the EmailValidationRule to a TextBox control's Text property.
> 
```XML
<TextBox Text="{Binding Email, UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged, ValidatesOnDataErrors=True}" />
```

> 3. Define a validation error template that specifies how to display validation errors to the user. For example, you can define a simple red border around the input field.

```XML
<Style TargetType="TextBox">
    <Style.Triggers>
        <Trigger Property="Validation.HasError" Value="True">
            <Setter Property="BorderBrush" Value="Red" />
            <Setter Property="BorderThickness" Value="2" />
        </Trigger>
    </Style.Triggers>
</Style>
```

> 4. Handle validation errors in your code-behind or view model, and provide error feedback to the user. For example, you can display a message box with the validation error message.

```C#
public class MyViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged, IDataErrorInfo
{
    public string Email { get; set; }

    public string Error => null;

    public string this[string columnName]
    {
        get
        {
            string error = null;

            if (columnName == "Email")
            {
                var validationRule = new EmailValidationRule();
                var validationResult = validationRule.Validate(Email, null);

                if (!validationResult.IsValid)
                {
                    error = validationResult.ErrorContent.ToString();
                    MessageBox.Show(error);
                }
            }

            return error;
        }
    }
}
```
>By using data validation rules, binding objects, validation error templates, and error feedback mechanisms, you can handle user input validation in a consistent and user-friendly way in your WPF application.
