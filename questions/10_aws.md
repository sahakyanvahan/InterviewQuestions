## 3. What are the Amazon SNS and Amazon SQS? What are differences between them?
### Answer
>Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a pub/sub messaging service that delivers messages to multiple subscribers, whereas Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) is a message queuing service that guarantees the delivery of messages to one consumer at a time. SNS is ideal for push-based, fan-out scenarios, while SQS is more suitable for decoupled, pull-based messaging.

>Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) and Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) are both messaging services provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). While they both facilitate communication between different components in a distributed system, they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics.

> **Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service):**

>* **Publish/Subscribe Pattern:** SNS follows the publish/subscribe pattern, where messages are sent to a topic, and multiple subscribers (endpoints) can receive copies of those messages independently.

>* **Push Notifications:** SNS is commonly used for sending push notifications to mobile devices, SMS messages, or email notifications to recipients.

>* **Fan-out Messaging:** When a message is published to a topic, it is delivered to all subscribers (endpoints) simultaneously.

>* **No Message Retention:** SNS does not retain messages; if a subscriber is not active at the time of message publication, the message is not delivered to that subscriber.

>* **No Ordering Guarantee:** SNS does not provide message ordering guarantees across multiple subscribers.

> **Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service):**

>* **Message Queuing:** SQS follows the message queuing model, where messages are sent to a queue and processed by consumers (subscribers) in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) manner.

>* **Pull-based Processing:** Consumers poll the SQS queue to receive messages and process them. SQS does not push messages directly to consumers.

>* **Decoupling Components:** SQS is commonly used to decouple components in a distributed system, ensuring that the components can work independently and asynchronously.

>* **Message Retention:** SQS retains messages in the queue for a configurable period (up to 14 days) until they are successfully processed or explicitly deleted.

>* **Message Ordering:** SQS provides message ordering guarantees for each message in the queue, ensuring that messages are processed in the order they were added to the queue (FIFO queue) or within a short time window (standard queue).

> **Differences between Amazon SNS and Amazon SQS:**

>* **Message Delivery:** SNS delivers messages to multiple subscribers simultaneously, whereas SQS delivers messages to a single consumer (subscriber) at a time.

>* **Message Retention:** SNS does not retain messages; it delivers messages to active subscribers immediately. In contrast, SQS retains messages in the queue for a specified retention period.

>* **Message Ordering:** SNS does not guarantee message ordering across multiple subscribers. SQS, on the other hand, provides message ordering guarantees within the context of a single queue.

>* **Push vs. Pull:** SNS is push-based, where messages are pushed to subscribers. SQS is pull-based, where consumers poll the queue to retrieve messages.

>* **Use Cases:** SNS is suitable for scenarios where you need to send notifications or messages to multiple subscribers simultaneously. SQS is ideal for decoupling components, managing workloads, and ensuring reliable message processing.

>In summary, Amazon SNS and Amazon SQS are both valuable messaging services in AWS, but they serve different use cases. SNS is best for broadcasting messages to multiple subscribers simultaneously (publish/subscribe), while SQS is more appropriate for decoupling components, managing workloads, and ensuring reliable and ordered message processing (message queuing).

## 4. What is aws dead letter queue. How it works?
### Answer

>An AWS Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) is a special type of queue used in conjunction with other AWS services like Amazon SQS and Amazon SNS. Its purpose is to capture and store messages that cannot be processed successfully by the primary (main) queue or topic subscribers. Dead Letter Queues are particularly useful for handling messages that encounter errors or failures during processing.

>Here's how AWS Dead Letter Queue works:

>* **Primary Queue or Topic:** The primary queue (in the case of SQS) or topic (in the case of SNS) is the main destination for incoming messages or notifications.

>* **Unsuccessful Message Processing:** When a message is sent to the primary queue or topic, it undergoes processing. If any error occurs during processing, or if the message exceeds the maximum number of delivery attempts, it becomes a candidate for the Dead Letter Queue.

>* **Configuring DLQ:** To use a Dead Letter Queue, you need to configure it with the primary queue or topic. You specify the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the Dead Letter Queue while creating or updating the primary queue or topic.

>* **Transfer to Dead Letter Queue:** If a message encounters an error, or if it exceeds the maximum delivery attempts, the primary queue or topic moves it to the Dead Letter Queue.

>* **Retries and Visibility Timeout:** Before moving a message to the Dead Letter Queue, SQS may automatically retry processing the message a certain number of times with a backoff mechanism. Also, SQS allows you to set a visibility timeout, during which a message is not visible to other consumers, to give time for the consumer to process the message successfully.

>* **Monitoring and Troubleshooting:** The Dead Letter Queue becomes a central place to capture and store problematic messages, allowing developers to investigate and troubleshoot the root cause of the processing errors.

>* **Redrive Policy:** In SQS, you define a "Redrive Policy" that specifies the maximum number of delivery attempts for a message before sending it to the Dead Letter Queue. Once a message exceeds this limit, it is moved to the Dead Letter Queue automatically.

>The Dead Letter Queue is an essential component in distributed systems to handle failed message processing and retries. By segregating problematic messages to a separate queue, it ensures that the primary queue or topic remains uncluttered and improves the overall reliability of the system.

>It's important to monitor the Dead Letter Queue and take corrective actions for messages that consistently fail processing. This may include investigating issues with message handling logic, fixing bugs, or adjusting the visibility timeout and maximum delivery attempts settings to accommodate specific requirements.
